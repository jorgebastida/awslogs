``awslogs`` is a simple command line tool for querying groups, streams and events from `Amazon CloudWatch <http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/>`_ logs.

One of the most powerful features is to query events from several streams and consume them (ordered) in pseudo-realtime using your favourite tools such as ``grep``::

    $ awslogs get /var/log/syslog ip-10-1.* --start='2h ago' | grep ERROR


Features
--------

* Aggregate logs from accross streams.

  - Aggregate all streams in a group.
  - Aggregate streams matching a regular expression.

* Colored output.
* List existing groups

  - ``$ awslogs groups``

* List existing streams

  - ``$ awslogs streams /var/log/syslog``

* Watch logs as they are created

  - ``$ awslogs get /var/log/syslog ALL --watch``

* Human-friendly time filtering:

  - ``--start='23/1/2015 14:23'``
  - ``--start='2h ago'``
  - ``--start='2d ago'``
  - ``--start='2w ago'``
  - ``--start='2d ago' --end='1h ago'``

Example
-------

Running: ``awslogs get /var/logs/syslog ALL -s1d`` will return you events from any ``stream`` in the ``/var/logs/syslog`` group generated in the last day.

Installation
------------

You can easily install ``awslogs`` using ``pip``::

  $ pip install awslogs


Options
-------

* ``awslogs groups``: List existing groups
* ``awslogs streams GROUP``: List existing streams withing ``GROUP``
* ``awslogs get [GROUP [STREAM_EXPRESSION]]``: Get logs matching ``STREAM_EXPRESSION`` in ``GROUP``.

  - Expressions can be regular expressions or the wildcard ``ALL`` if you want any and don't want to type ``.*``.

**Note:** You need to provide to all these options a valid AWS region using ``--aws-region`` or ``AWS_REGION`` env variable.


Time options
-------------

While querying for logs you can filter events by ``--start`` ``-s`` and ``--end`` ``-e`` date.

* By minute:

  - ``--start='2m'`` Events generated two minutes ago.
  - ``--start='1 minute'`` Events generated one minute ago.
  - ``--start='5 minutes'`` Events generated five minutes ago.

* By hours:

  - ``--start='2h'`` Events generated two hours ago.
  - ``--start='1 hour'`` Events generated one hour ago.
  - ``--start='5 hours'`` Events generated five hours ago.

* By days:

  - ``--start='2d'`` Events generated two days ago.
  - ``--start='1 day'`` Events generated one day ago.
  - ``--start='5 days'`` Events generated five days ago.

* By weeks:

  - ``--start='2w'`` Events generated two week ago.
  - ``--start='1 week'`` Events generated one weeks ago.
  - ``--start='5 weeks'`` Events generated five week ago.

* Using specific dates:

  - ``--start='23/1/2015 12:00'`` Events generated after midday  on the 23th of January 2015.
  - ``--start='1/1/2015'`` Events generated after midnight on the 1st of January 2015.
  - ``--start='Sat Oct 11 17:13:46 UTC 2003'`` You can use detailed dates too.

  Note, for time parsing awslogs uses `dateutil <https://dateutil.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.

* All previous examples are applicable for  ``--end`` ``-e`` too.

How to provide AWS credentials to awslogs
------------------------------------------

Although, the most straightforward thing to do might be use ``--aws-access-key-id`` and ``--aws-secret-access-key`` this will eventually become a pain in the ass.

* If you only have one ``AWS`` account, my personal recommendation would be to configure `aws-cli <http://aws.amazon.com/cli/>`_. ``awslogs`` will use those credentials if available.
* If you have multiple ``AWS`` accounts or you don't want to setup ``aws-cli``, I would recommend you to use `envdir <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/envdir>`_ in order to make ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`` and ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`` available to ``awslogs``.
